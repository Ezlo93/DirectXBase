# Pong 3D
Implementing a four player split screen Pong in 3D using C++ and DirectX11. 

Players can join in the start screen using controller or the keyboard. If there aren't four players the remaining players will be controlled by bots. Real players start with 3 lives. When only one player is alive, there's a winner's ceremony.
